# Artboard Plus

Artboard tools to speed up your Adobe XD workflow. Rearrange artboards into grid, sort them by name or create an artboard around selection.

## Rearange artboards into grid

Run the command `Plugins → Artboard Plus → Rearrange Artboards into Grid` to rearrange all artboards in the document. If you have selected artboards, it will rearrange only the selected ones.

## Sort artboards

Sort artboards by name in the layer list or by x y position on the canvas. 
- Alphabetical: Run the command `Plugins → Artboard Plus → Sort Artboards by Name A-Z` for ascending order or `Plugins → Artboard Plus → Sort Artboards by Name Z-A` for descending order
- X Y Position: Run the command `Plugins → Artboard Plus → Sort Artboards Left to Right, Top to Bottom` to sort artboards horizontally, then vertically. Run `Plugins → Artboard Plus → Sort Artboards Top to Bottom, Left to Right` to sort vertically first
<!-- do you want to be a good citizen of the world and also support r-t-l sorting for our arabic and hebrew bros? -->

## Settings

This is where you set the horizontal and vertical spacing when rearranging artboards. **Due to Adobe XD incompatibility these settings can only be saved globally and not per document**
